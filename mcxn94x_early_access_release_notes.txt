Zephyr MCXN94X Early Access Release 1.0
=======================================

This document outlines the committed features and support intended by this
early access release.

Supported Devices
-----------------
This and following EAR releases for the MCXN94X currently are only guaranteeing
support for the MCXN947VDF derivative of the MCXN947 series.

Structure of Released Code
--------------------------
The software patches for this early access of the MCXN947 Zephyr support are
released as two git branches, one for the NXP HAL module and one for the Zephyr
tree. The name of the branch on the Zephyr repo is "mcxn94x_ear". The
name of the branch on the HAL NXP repo is "mcxn94x_ear". Each branch is based
off of the point of the official Zephyr v3.3.0 release.

Overview of Supported Features
------------------------------
- Basic zephyr infrastructure to target MCXN9XX Breakout board
  and MCXN947VDF SOC by the zephyr build.
- Name of supported board is "mcxn9xxbrk_cm33_cpu0".
- A default system clock setup in zephyr soc initialization stage is provided.
- Pin control subsystem is implemented on the PORT peripherals.
- OS Timer is enabled
- LPUART is enabled.
- GPIO is enabled.


Testing Done on Supported Features
----------------------------------
- Basic zephyr infrastucture was tested by confirming that the zephyr image
  targeting the MCXN94X builds and can be loaded into the MCXN94X flash memory
  region, and then is executed by the core processor.
- Clock setup was observed manually using a debugger and looking at peripheral
  registers, mainly the SCG and SYSCON. The other features also rely on the
  clock setup in order to function correctly, so this was indirectly tested.
- Zephyr kernel functions were tested using tests/kernel/common.
- Pin control was also a dependency for other features to show expected
  behaviour. The PORT registers were also manually observed while debugging
  the application of pin control states in driver code.
- LPUART was tested using the samples/hello_world in-tree sample,
  and also subsequently became a dependency for getting serial console
  output to observe the results of other feature tests.
- GPIO was tested using the samples/basic/blinky in-tree sample, which uses
  GPIO to toggle a LED on the Breakout board.
- GPIO was also tested using the samples/basic/button in-tree sample,
  which uses a switch input to toggle a LED on the Breakout board.
Any functionality not covered by one of the tests is not guaranteed.

Non-secure version of devicetree is not supported.
